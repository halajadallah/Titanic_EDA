## Titanic dataset exploratory analysis

This project was submitted as part of Udacity's Data Analyst nano degree program. This is my first analysis using Python. 

The data set has 891 records and twelve variables. The variables are of different types, variables that are continuous such as ticket fare and age, variables that are ordinals such as socio-econimic class,  variables that are categorical such as sex, survived, port of embarkation, Ticket code, cabin code, and variables that are discrete/counts such as number of parent/child companions or number of spouse/sibling companions.

My analysis includes exploration of these variables using basic descriptive statistical summaries as well as various visuals such as bar plot, histograms, scatter plots and swarm plots. I focused on using various Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn functions.

Some highlights from results:

* Survival was mainly determined by sex, class, and age. Lower class young males where the most at risk followed by lower class females. This is confirmed using a logistic regression model using R. 

* Sixty five percent of passenges where  males, of those sixty percent come from lower class, nineteen from middle class, and twenty one from upper class.

* Fourty six percent of females from from lower class, twenty four from middle class and thirty percent from upper class.
